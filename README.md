Introduction

Twit bot is an open source software, I decided to do this project in 1 week as a benchmark for myself. A small portal
to allow users to sign up via twitter and do following

    1) Auto follow certain hashtags
    2) Auto favorite certain hashtags
    3) Auto follow back
    4) Auto unfollow backard
    5) Schedule tweets

A version of the software will be running on twit-bot.mocorner.com open for public use, free of charge.
